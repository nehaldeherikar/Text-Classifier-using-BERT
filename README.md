# Text-Classifier-using-BERT
Tools - Python, Pandas, Amazon S3, Amazon SageMaker Pipelines, Amazon SageMaker Feature Store.

Method - Natural Language Processing using BERT, ML Pipelines and MLOps.

Description - Build a SageMaker Pipeline to train and deploy a BERT-Based text classifier to predict the
sentiment for each customer review.
  
      Defined and run a pipeline using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with specific pipeline parameters and model
      hyper-parameters

      Defined a processing step that cleans, balances, transforms and splits our dataset into the train, validation,
      and test dataset

      Defined a training step that trains a model using the train and validation datasets

      Defined a processing step that evaluates the trained model's performance on the test dataset

      Defined a register model step that creates a model package from the trained model

      Defined a conditional step that checks the model's performance and conditionally registers the model for
      deployment.
